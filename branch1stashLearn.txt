LEARNING GIT STASH. WHY WE DO GIT STASH ? 
IF WE HAVE TO SWITCH BETWEEN BRANCHES.ASSUME YOU ARE IN WORKING_BRANCH AND YOU HAVE TO SWITCH TO EMERGENCY_BRANCH FOR SOME BUGS TO SOLVE.
CHANGES IN WORKING_BRANCH IS NOT ENOUGH FOR NEW FEATURE SO WE DONT WANT COMMIT FOR INCOMPLETE TASK.IN SUCH CASE WE STASH THOSE CHANGES
==========================================
I first entered in branch1.
Added new file <file1.txt>
Then didnot add or commit that file
but i switched in next branch
if i do 'ls command' in next branch
you can see that <file1.txt>
why you can see ?
because this file is not tracked or saved so doesnt belong to any branches.
so if we go to branch1 
and did git add 
and again switched to next branch and did 'ls command'
still you can see that <file1.txt>
while switching like this it may cause chaos or conflict.As my branches are different.do their respective job
SO to avoid this. 
Go to the branch where you want <file1.txt> belong
WHAT I DID
 I WENT TO branch1 and did git stash
then went to next branch and did 'ls command'
NOW I DONT SEE <file1.txt>
=====================================================
NOW YOU DID YOUR EMERGENCY TASK AND CAME BACK TO WORKING_BRANCH AND DID "ls command" you wont see <file1.txt>
INORDER TO SEE IT YOU HAVE TO DO git stast pop
